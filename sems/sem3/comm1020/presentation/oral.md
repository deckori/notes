Let’s look at the three criteria we’ll use to compare our two solutions: **strength, durability, and resilience.**

**Strength** is how much force a material can safely withstand. In our case, we focus on **compressive strength**—how well it resists being crushed. Think of the ground beneath us: if its compressive strength were too low, I’d sink like I’m standing on quicksand.

**Durability** is how well a material resists **wear and damage over time**, including repeated loading and exposure to water.

And **resilience** is its ability to **bounce back after stress**—to recover shape and stability after repeated loads, such as vehicles passing over a road.

For **concrete**, studies by *Guo et al.* and *Soundararajan* show that adding recycled plastic slightly lowers strength but keeps it within safe limits. It also improves resistance to water and cracking, giving the concrete better durability and impact performance.

For **pavement subgrades**, *Abukhettala and Fall* found that plastic increases flexibility and waterproofing but reduces load capacity. Over time, the layers can weaken under repeated heavy traffic, even though they show higher resilience values.

So, while both materials benefit in some ways, the trade-offs are different.

When we compare the two directly:

* **Concrete** with a controlled amount with of recycled plasti aggregate maintains structural reliability and shows better long-term durability and wear resistance.
* **Subgrade** becomes more flexible but less stable under continuous loading.

Overall, plastic infused concrete performs more consistently and meets safety standards for general construction, while subgrades still need improvement before large-scale use.

In conclusion, using recycled plastic in **concrete** is the stronger and more sustainable option. It improves durability and resilience, reduces maintenance, and offers a reliable way to reuse plastic waste.

This method not only keeps plastic out of the environment but also conserves natural resources and energy—helping move construction toward a greener future.
