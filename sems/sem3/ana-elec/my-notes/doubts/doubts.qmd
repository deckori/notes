2. What is a general definition of feedback? What about resistive feedback?

## T2

1. What is the meaning of quiescent?

## T4.1

1. explain:

## T4.3

1. How to determine the Q point in a graph?

## T4.4

BJT - Voltage Divider Configuration

Why is $I_C = I_VB$?

## T5

1. What is a decoupling capacitor?
  - Used to block DC voltage
2. What is a bypass capacitor?
  - Used to increase the gain. How?
3. Why doesn't the capacitor affect the phase difference of the voltage? Is it only relevant b/w the voltage and current?
4. What happens to the $V_{DS}$ and $I_D$ when $V_{DS} > V_p$?
5. what happens when Vgs becomes more and more positive in n-channel jfet?
  - $I_{DS}$ becomes smaller and smaller until it becomes 0. When $V_{GS} > 0 V$, then JFET is off
6. What happens if a JFET turns off?
7. is it ok for V_DS to be negative in an n-channel jfet? How does it behave?
 
## T6

1. What is feedback?
  - {{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua4eMZTxpQ0&t=3s >}}
2. Affect of the negative feedback of resistors on the output? Is this AC or DC attribute?
  - Negative feedback nullifies a change in the output. It is a part of both AC and DC.
3. What is open loop gain?
4. Purpose of resistors in closed loop gain
5. Open loop gain vs closed loop gain
6. What charateristics of the op-amp does closed loop gain configuration improve?
7. What are sensor conditioning circuits? how does it relate to the integrator configuration of the op-amp?
