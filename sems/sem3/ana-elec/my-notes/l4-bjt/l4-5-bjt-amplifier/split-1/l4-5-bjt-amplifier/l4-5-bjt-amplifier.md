### BJT-Amplifier:-

- Amplification is the process of linearly increasing the amplitude of an electrical signal and is one of the major properties of a transistor.
- BJT exhibits current gain (called beta).
- When a BJT is biased in the active (or linear) region, as previously described, the BE junction has a low resistance due to forward bias and the BC junction has a high resistance due to reverse bias.

### BJT-Amplifier:-

#### Recall:

- The purpose of biasing is to establish a Q-point about which variations in current and voltage can occur in response to an ac input signal.
- In applications where small signal voltages must be amplified such as from an antenna or a microphone—variations about the Qpoint are relatively small.

### Linear BJT-Amplifier:-

- A **linear amplifier** provides amplification of a signal without any distortion so that the output signal is an exact *amplified replica*  of the input signal.
- *Example opposite shows, A voltagedivider biased transistor with a sinusoidal ac source.*
- *The coupling capacitors block dc and thus prevent the internal source resistance, R<sup>s</sup> , and the load resistance, R<sup>L</sup> , from changing the dc bias voltages at the base and collector.*

• The capacitors ideally appear as shorts to the AC signal voltage.

### Linear BJT-Amplifier:-

- *As the sinusoidal collector current increases, the collector voltage decreases.*
- The collector current varies above and below its Q-point value, ICQ, in phase with the base current.
- VCEQ, 1800 out of phase with the base voltage.

• *A transistor always produces a phase inversion between the base voltage and the collector voltage.*
