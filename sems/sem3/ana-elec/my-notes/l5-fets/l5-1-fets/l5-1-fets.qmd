- FETs are classified into:
  1. Junction field effect transistor, **JFET**
  2. Metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor, **MOSFET**

{3}------------------------------------------------

- The three terminals are the:
  1. Gate
  2. Drain
  3. Source

{4}------------------------------------------------

- Because of their **nonlinear characteristics**, they are generally not as widely used in amplifiers as BJTs except where very high input impedances are required
- FETs are the preferred device in low voltage switching applications, **Why?**

**Ans:** Because they can perform fast switching, faster than BJTs when turned on and off

![](_page_4_Picture_5.jpeg){width="300px" fig-align="center"}

{5}------------------------------------------------

- The input impedance is extremely high (Megohms) for FETs, so they require very little power from the driving source

### Applications

- Useful in integrated circuit (IC) chips
  > Because they are smaller

### Junction Field Effect Transistor-JFET

- The **JFET** (junction field-effect transistor) is a type of FET that operates with a reverse-biased p-n junction to control current in a channel
- Depending on their structure, JFETs fall into either of two categories-
  - n channel, called n-channel JFET
  - p channel, called p-channel JFET

- The only difference is the direction of the arrow on the gate lead
- The arrow points in toward the n -type channel, whereas the arrow points outward from the ptypeon channel

{9}------------------------------------------------

#### JFET- Operation

- The amount of current flow (for a fixed value of VGS) depends upon two factors:
  - The value of the drain-source voltage, VDS
  - The drain-source resistance, designated rds

![](_page_9_Picture_5.jpeg){width="300px" fig-align="center"}

- The value of rds is dependent on the doping level, cross sectional area, and length of the doped semiconductor material used for the channel
- In a JFET, the source current, IS, and the drain current, I<sup>D</sup> are the same
- In most cases, therefore, the current flow is considered to be only the drain current, I<sup>D</sup>

{10}------------------------------------------------

#### JFET- Basic Operation

- DC bias voltages applied to an n-channel device:
  - VDD provides a drain-to-source voltage and supplies current from drain to source
  - VGG sets the reverse-bias voltage between the gate and the source
- JFET is always operated with the gatesource pn junction reverse-biased

![](_page_10_Picture_6.jpeg){width="300px" fig-align="center"}

{11}------------------------------------------------

- Reverse-biasing of the gate-source junction produces a depletion region along the pn junction, which extends into the channel
- It increases its resistance by restricting the channel width
- Therefore, the channel width and thus the channel resistance can be controlled by varying the gate voltage, thereby controlling the amount of drain current, I<sup>D</sup>

### JFET- Characteristics and Parameters

Case when the gate-to-source voltage is zero (VGS = 0 V).

- Increasing VDD (and thus VDS) from 0V, ID will increase proportionally, between points A and B
- **Ohmic Region:** In this area, the channel resistance is essentially constant because the depletion region is not large enough to have significant effect
- In ohmic region VDS and ID are related by Ohm's law

#### JFET- Characteristics and Parameters

{{< video https://youtu.be/-o39YVNMYVs >}}

Case when the gate-to-source voltage is zero (VGS = 0 V).

- Breakdown occurs at point C when I<sup>D</sup> begins to increase very rapidly with any further increase in VDS
- Breakdown can result in irreversible damage to the device, so JFETs are always operated below breakdown and within the active region (constant current) (between points B and C on the graph)

![](_page_15_Figure_5.jpeg){width="300px" fig-align="center"}

- Pinch-off voltage is the value of $V_{DS}$ at which drain current $I_D$ reaches a constant saturation value

>- At this condition the depletion layers in a FET appear to touch each other and looks like a pinch, hence the reason for the name
>- The current density increases instead of the current decreasing due to the decreasing space
>- If the depletion layers touch, then $I_D=0\ A \implies$ the potential difference b/w the middle of the depletion layer and the p layer, $V_{pddl}=0\ V=V_{GS}$
>  - The width of depletions layers increase because of the positive potential difference $V_{( pddl )-GS}$, and if this does not exist, the width stops increasing

{16}------------------------------------------------

## JFET- Characteristics and Parameters

{{< video https://youtu.be/Dd4im8TMAk0 >}}

- Family of drain characteristic curves is produced, as VGS is set to increasingly more negative values by adjusting VGG

![](_page_16_Figure_3.jpeg){width="300px" fig-align="center"}

- Pinch-off occurs at a lower VDS as VGS is increased to more negative values

### MOSFET - Basic Operation

{{< video https://youtu.be/4_nGFY7zgDM >}}

{{< video https://youtu.be/ybPQ1IDfTb8 >}}

- MOSFETs can operate in two modes:
  - Depletion mode (like the JFET), where the ability to pass current can be reduced or increased
    - The channel exists between the source and drain and allows a current to flow $I_{DSS}$ even when $V_{GS}$ = $\theta V$
  - Enhancement mode, where the ability to pass current is increased
    - For current to flow channel need to be created by applying gate voltage above a threshold voltage VGS(th).

| Depletion-type MOSFET                 | Enhancement-type MOSFET               |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Channel initially present b/w D and S | Channel initially  absent b/w D and S |
|                                       |                                       |

The only difference between n- and p-channel devices is that the supply voltage used for p-channel devices is of the opposite polarity from that used for n-channel devices.
