# Lecture # 2 – Semiconductor Diodes

# Objectives:

Develop a working knowledge of the diode in a variety of configurations using models appropriate for the area of application\.

Sketch a PN junction under zero bias and show the depletion zones indicating the relative charges of each area\.

Explain what happens to majority and minority carriers present in the different parts of the diode\.

Explain Biasing Voltage \(Forward and Reverse\)

Show what happens to the depletion zone\, majority and minority carriers in the presence of forward and reverse biasing voltages.

# Diodes

The diode is a 2\-terminal device\.

A diode ideally conducts in only one direction\.

 __Semiconductor Resistance:__ 

Intrinsic semiconductor \(not doped\) : high resistance \(since very few free electrons or holes\)\.

N\-type semiconductor \(doped with donors\): low resistance \(due to lots of free electrons\)\.

P\-type semiconductor \(doped with acceptors\): low resistance \(due to lots of holes\)

 __Semiconductor Materials:__ 

Materials commonly used in the development of semiconductor devices:

Silicon \(Si\)

Germanium \(Ge\)

Gallium Arsenide \(GaAs\)

One end of a silicon or germanium crystal can be doped as a p-type material and the other end as an n\-type material\.

The result is a p\-n junction \.

It turns out that doing this makes a _diode _ – a device with very useful characteristics\.

Some of the free electrons from the n\-type material flow into p\-type material\.

![](l2-diode-img/l2-diode_7.png)

Creating an area near the junction where the free electrons have left the n\-type material\, and the holes are filled in the p\-type material\.

This is called the _depletion_ _ _ _region_ \.

![](l2-diode-img/l2-diode_8.png)

![](l2-diode-img/l2-diode_9.jpg)

If we consider the resistance of the p\-n junction\, we see that the depletion region has _very high _ _resistance_ \. 

Why ?

Because the depletion region is just like an intrinsic semiconductor with no extra free electrons and holes due to doping\.

There exists a potential difference across the depletion layer and is called barrier potential \(V 0 \) \.

The typical barrier potential is approximately:

For silicon\, V 0 = 0\.7 V 

For germanium\, V 0 = 0\.3 V

 __Diode Operating Conditions:__ 

A diode has three operating conditions:

No bias

Reverse bias

Forward bias

![](l2-diode-img/l2-diode_10.png)

![](l2-diode-img/l2-diode_11.jpg)

No Bias

No external voltage is applied: _V_ _D_ _ _ = 0 V  _I_ _D_ _ _ = 0 A

 __Diode Operating Conditions:__ 

![](l2-diode-img/l2-diode_12.png)

The reverse voltage causes the depletion region to widen\.

The electrons in the _n_ \-type material are attracted toward the positive terminal of the voltage source\.

The holes in the _p_ \-type material are attracted toward the negative terminal of the voltage source\.

![](l2-diode-img/l2-diode_13.png)

![](l2-diode-img/l2-diode_14.jpg)

 __Diode Operating Conditions:__ 

![](l2-diode-img/l2-diode_15.png)

External voltage is applied across the _p\-n _ junction in the same polarity as the _p_ \- and _n_ \-type materials\.

The forward voltage causes the depletion region to narrow\.

The electrons and holes are pushed toward the _p\-n_ _ _ junction\.

The electrons and holes have sufficient energy to cross the _p\-n _ _ _ junction\.

Note the regions for reverse bias\, and forwardd bias conditions\.

Observe the scale for each of these conditions\.

 __Practical Diode Characteristics:__ 

![](l2-diode-img/l2-diode_21.jpg)

Actual real diode is not perfect\.

It has a very small current through it when reverse biased\.

And it has a small voltage across it when it is forward biased\.

0\.7 V for Si

0\.3 V for Ge

1\.2 V GaAs


 __Reverse Breakdown characteristics of a Diode__ 

![](l2-diode-img/l2-diode_22.jpg)

If we apply excess voltage on a real diode in the reverse direction \, the diode will be destroyed and will let current flow in the reverse direction\. 

This is called the breakdown voltage \.

 __Light\-Emitting Diode __ __\(LED\)__ 

An LED emits photons when it is forward biased\.

The color of light emitted by the diode is determined by the type of material used in doping\.

The forward bias voltage is usually in the range of 2 V to 3 V\.
