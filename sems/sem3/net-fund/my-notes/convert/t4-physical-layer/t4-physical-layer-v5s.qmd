## **Purpose of the Physical Layer**

## **The Physical Layer**

- Accepts a complete frame from the Data Link Layer and encodes it as a series of signals that are transmitted to the local media
- Transports bits across the network media
- The next device in the path to the destination receives the bits and reencapsulates the frame, then decides what to do with it.

- Implemented in hardware
- Address three functional areas:
  - Physical Components hardware devices, media, and other connectors that transmit the signals.
  - Encoding
  - Signaling

{4}------------------------------------------------

### **Physical Layer Characteristics Encoding**

- **Encoding** converts the stream of bits into a format recognizable by the next device in the network path.
- For example, the Manchester encoding shown in the figure represents a 0 bit by a high to low voltage transition, and a 1 bit is represented as a low to high voltage transition.

> bit duration: it is the time interval for which a binary value lasts (before changing)
>
> There are different schemes to interpret binary signals. For example, using the edges (transitions as Manchester encoding)

{5}------------------------------------------------

### **Physical Layer Characteristics Signaling**

The signaling method is how the bit values, "1" and "0" are represented on the physical medium.

> Signaling is the process of conversion of an analog signal to a digitally transferrable signal

## **Physical Layer Characteristics Bandwidth Terminology**

>- Each group of data to be sent is called a segment
- **Bandwidth**: the capacity at which a medium can carry data.
  - Physical media properties, current technologies, and the laws of physics play a role in determining available bandwidth.
- **Latency**: the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another
- **Throughput**: the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time
- **Overhead:** the amount of data traffic required for establishing sessions, acknowledgments, and encapsulation
>   - It is the extra data (not the actual user data to be transferred) transferred.
- **Goodput**: the measure of usable data transferred over a given period of time
  - Goodput = Throughput Overhead

{7}------------------------------------------------

## **Copper Cabling Characteristics of Copper Cabling**

 Copper cabling is the most common type of cabling used in networks today. It is inexpensive, easy to install, and has low resistance to electrical current flow.

### Limitations:

- Attenuation: the longer the electrical signals have to travel, the weaker they get.

> It means decrease in the signal power as the distance increases. So here, there is high attenuation

> SNR: Signal to Noise Ratio. It should be above a certain point for a connection to be made.

> Repeaters are devices used to amplify the weak signals
> - They modulate the input, and then remodulate

- Susceptible to interference from two sources:
  - Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
    - EMI and RFI signals can distort and corrupt the data signals being carried by copper media.
    - Sources of EMI and RFI include fluorescent lights or electric motors.
  - Crosstalk a disturbance caused by the electric/magnetic fields of a signal on one wire to the signal in an adjacent wire, resulting in hearing part of another voice conversation from an adjacent circuit.

### Mitigation:

- Strict adherence to cable length limits to reduce attenuation.
- Using metallic shielding and grounding to reduce EMI and RFI
- Twisting opposing circuit pair wires together to reduce crosstalk

# Copper Cabling Types of Copper Cabling

![](_page_8_Picture_1.jpeg)

| Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP) Cable | Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP) Cable | Coaxial Cable |
|-|-|-|

{9}------------------------------------------------

## Copper Cabling Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)

- UTP is the most common networking media.
- Terminated with RJ-45 connectors
- Interconnects hosts with intermediary network devices

![](_page_9_Picture_5.jpeg)

#### Key Characteristics of UTP

1. The outer jacket protects the copper wires from physical damage.
2. Twisted pairs protect the signal from interference.
3. Color-coded plastic insulation electrically isolates the wires from each other and identifies each pair.

{10}------------------------------------------------

## Copper Cabling Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)

- Better noise protection than UTP
- More expensive than UTP
- Harder to install than UTP
- Terminated with RJ-45 connectors
- Interconnects hosts with intermediary network devices

![](_page_10_Picture_6.jpeg)

#### Key Characteristics of STP

1. The outer jacket protects the copper wires from physical damage
2. Braided or foil shield provides EMI/RFI protection
3. Foil shield for each pair of wires provides EMI/RFI protection
4. Color-coded plastic insulation electrically isolates the wires from each other and identifies each pair


{11}------------------------------------------------

### Copper Cabling Coaxial Cable

#### Consists of the following:

1. Outer cable jacket to prevent minor physical damage
2. A woven copper braid, or metallic foil, acts as the second wire in the circuit and as a shield for the inner conductor.
3. A layer of flexible plastic insulation
4. A copper conductor is used to transmit the electronic signals.

There are different types of connectors used with coax cable: BNC, N, F.

#### Commonly used in:

- Wireless installations - attach antennas to wireless devices
- Cable internet installations - customer premises wiring

{12}------------------------------------------------

### **UTP Cabling Properties of UTP Cabling**

- Because the UTP cable does not use shielding to counter the effects of EMI and RFI, the **negative effect of crosstalk is reduced by**:
  - **Cancellation** The wires in a circuit are paired, so that the magnetic fields in a pair are exactly opposite of each other, cancelling each other and any outside EMI and RFI signals.
  - Varying the number of twists per wire pair - Each colored pair is twisted a different number of times.

{13}------------------------------------------------

#### UTP Cabling

## UTP Cabling Standards and Connectors

Standards for UTP are established by the **TIA/EIA. TIA/EIA-568** standardizes elements like:

- Cable Types and Lengths
- Connectors
- Cable Termination
- Testing Methods

Electrical standards for copper cabling are established by the **IEEE**, which rates cable according to its performance. Examples include:

- Category 3
- Category 5 and 5e
- Category 6

- **Straight-through cable**: between devices at different layers
- **Crossover cable**: between devices at similar layers.
- **Rollover cable**: for console connection to a router/switch port

* - Considered legacy due to most NICs using Auto-MDIX to sense cable type and complete connection

> Auto-MDIX: Devices are smart enough to know which standards are used by the connected cable. So any of the mentioned standards can be used with mentioned devices


{16}------------------------------------------------

## **Fiber-Optic Cabling**

### **Fiber-Optic Cabling Properties of Fiber-Optic Cabling**

- Not as common as UTP because of the high cost
- Transmits data over longer distances at higher bandwidth than any other networking media
- Less susceptible to attenuation, and completely immune to EMI/RFI
- Made of flexible, extremely thin strands of very pure glass
- Uses a laser or LED to encode bits as pulses of light
- The fiber-optic cable acts as a wave guide to transmit light between the two ends with minimal signal loss

{17}------------------------------------------------

# **Types of Fiber Media**

### Single-Mode Fiber Multimode Fiber

![](_page_17_Figure_4.jpeg)

- Very small core
- Uses expensive lasers
- Long-distance applications

![](_page_17_Figure_9.jpeg)

- Larger core
- Uses less expensive LEDs
- LEDs transmit at different angles
- Up to 10 Gbps over 550 meters

Dispersion refers to the spreading out of a light pulse over time. Increased dispersion means increased loss of signal strength. MMF has greater dispersion than SMF. The maximum cable distance for MMF is 550 meters.

{18}------------------------------------------------

### **Fiber-Optic Cabling Fiber-Optic Cabling Usage**

### **Fiber-optic cabling is now being used in four types of industry:**

- **1. Enterprise Networks -** Used for backbone cabling applications and interconnecting infrastructure devices
- **2. Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) -** Used to provide always-on broadband services to homes and small businesses
- **3. Long-Haul Networks -** Used by service providers to connect countries and cities
- **4. Submarine Cable Networks -** Used to provide reliable high-speed, high-capacity solutions capable of surviving in harsh undersea environments at up to transoceanic distances.

{22}------------------------------------------------

## **Wireless Media**

## **Properties of Wireless Media**

 It carries electromagnetic signals representing binary digits using radio or microwave frequencies. This provides the greatest mobility option.

- Some of the limitations of wireless:
  - Coverage area Effective coverage can be significantly impacted by the physical characteristics of the deployment location.
  - Interference Wireless is susceptible to interference and can be disrupted by many common devices.
  - Security Wireless communication coverage requires no access to a physical transmission media, so anyone can gain access to the transmission.
  - Shared medium WLANs operate in half-duplex, which means only one device can send or receive at a time. Many users accessing the WLAN simultaneously results in reduced bandwidth for each user.

{23}------------------------------------------------

## **Wireless Media Standards**

- **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)**  Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology
- **Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15)**  Wireless Personal Area network (WPAN) standard
- **WiMAX (IEEE 802.16)**  Uses a point-to-multipoint topology to provide broadband wireless access
- **Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)**  Low data-rate, low power-consumption communications, primarily for Internet of Things (IoT) applications
