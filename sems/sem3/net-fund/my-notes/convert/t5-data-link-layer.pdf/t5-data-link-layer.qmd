#### Purpose of Data Link layer:

1. Prepares network data for the physical network.
2. Is responsible for network interface card (NIC) to NIC communications.

#### Data Link does the following functions:

1. Accepts Layer 3 packets and encapsulates them into Layer 2 frames.
2. Controls how data is placed and received on the media.
3. Exchanges frames between endpoints over the network media.
4. Receives encapsulated Layer 3 packets and directs them to the proper upper-layer protocol.
5. Performs error detection and rejects any corrupt frame.

### IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Data Link Sublayers

- IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards are specific to the type of network (Ethernet, WLAN, WPAN, etc.).
- The Data Link Layer consists of two sublayers and.
  - Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer communicates between:
    - Networking software at the upper layers
    - Device hardware at the lower layers.
  - Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer provides:
    - Data encapsulation
      - Addressing source and destination addressing for transporting the Layer 2 frame between devices on the same shared medium.
      - Error detection includes a trailer used to detect transmission errors.
    - Media access control to allow multiple devices to communicate over a shared medium.

# **2. Topologies WAN Topologies**

#### **There are three common physical WAN topologies.**

**Point-to-point –** the simplest and most common WAN topology. Consists of a permanent link between two endpoints.

**Hub and spoke –** similar to a star topology where a central site interconnects branch sites through point-to-point links.

**Mesh –** provides high availability but requires every end system to be connected to every other end system.

# **2. Topologies LAN Topologies**

- **Star** and **extended star**  topologies
  - Typically used to interconnect end devices on LANs
  - Very scalable and easy to install and troubleshoot

## **Legacy LAN topologies**

- **Early Ethernet Bus**  All end systems chained together with coaxial cable and terminated on each end.
- **Legacy Token Ring** Each end system is connected to its respective neighbors to form a ring.

# **2. Topologies Half and Full Duplex Communication**

## **Half-duplex communication**

- Only allows one device to send or receive at a time on a shared medium.
- Used on WLANs and legacy bus topologies with Ethernet hubs.

![](_page_8_Picture_5.jpeg)

## **Full-duplex communication**

- Allows both devices to simultaneously transmit and receive on a shared medium.
- Ethernet switches operate in fullduplex mode.

## **2. Topologies**

# **Access Control Methods**

**A multiaccess network** is a network that can have two or more end devices attempting to access the network simultaneously. Examples: Ethernet LANs and WLANs.

#### **Contention-based access**

- Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (**CSMA/CD**) - used on legacy bus-topology Ethernet.
- Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (**CSMA/CA**) - used on Wireless LANs.

#### **Controlled access**

- Deterministic access, where each node has its own time on the medium.
- Used on legacy networks such as Token Ring.

#### 2. Topologies

## Contention-Based Access – CSMA/CD

- Used by legacy Ethernet LANs.
- Operates in half-duplex mode where only one device sends or receives at a time.
- Uses a collision detection process to control when a device can send and what happens if multiple devices send at the same time.
  - 1. Devices transmitting simultaneously will result in a signal collision on the shared media.
  - 2. Devices detect the collision and wait a random period of time and retransmit data.

![](_page_10_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Process steps:** 

- 1. The PC1 sends the Ethernet Frame to PC3 when the medium is available.
- 2. The Ethernet hub receives frame and sends it to all ports.
- 3. If another device, such as PC2, wants to transmit, but is currently receiving a frame, it must wait until the transmission channel is clear.
- 4. All devices attached to the hub will receive the frame.
- Because the frame has a destination data link address for PC3, only that device will accept the frame. All other devices will ignore the frame.


{11}------------------------------------------------

#### **2. Topologies**

# **Contention-Based Access – CSMA/CA**

- Used by IEEE 802.11 WLANs.
- Operates in half-duplex mode where only one device sends or receives at a time.
- Uses a collision avoidance process to govern when a device can send and what happens if multiple devices send at the same time.
  - 1. Each device that transmits includes the time duration that it needs for the transmission.
  - 2. All other wireless devices receive this information and know how long the medium will be unavailable..

![](_page_11_Figure_8.jpeg)

#### **Process steps:**

- 1. If host A is receiving a wireless frame from the **access point**, hosts B and C will also see the frame and how long the transmission medium will be unavailable.
- 2.After a wireless device sends an 802.11 frame, the receiver returns an acknowledgment so that the sender knows the frame arrived.

# **3. Data Link Frame The Frame and Frame Fields**

**Data is encapsulated by the data link layer with a header and a trailer to form a frame.**

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frame Start and Stop | Identifies beginning and end of frame                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Addressing           | Indicates source and destination nodes                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Type                 | Identifies encapsulated Layer 3 protocol                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Control              | Identifies flow control services such as quality of service (QoS). QoS gives<br>forwarding priority to certain types of messages. For example, voice over IP (VoIP)<br>frames normally receive priority because they are sensitive to delay. |
| Data                 | Contains the frame payload                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Error Detection      | Used to determine transmission errors                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
