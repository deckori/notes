## The Subnet Mask

In binary for of the subnet mask:

-   The 0s represent the host part of the IP address
-   The 1s represent the network part of the IP address

2 addresses cannot be assigned to an end device:

-   Network address: 1st possible address
-   Broadcast address: last possible address

The host address lies in between these 2 addresses

## Network Segmentation

### Problems with Large Broadcast Domains

When we create subnets, we borrow bits from host bits to create the subnet. The borrowed bits become part of the new group of network bits

We can create subnets as long as enough host bits are available. We can create subnets even in a /24 or /27 address space.

When configuring subnets, the minimum number of required host bits is 2. So /30 is the maximum subnet mask for an IPv4 address.

In a /24 IPv4 address, $2^6$ max subnets. 2 host addresses

Subnetting has 2 requirements:

1.  How many subnets do we need?
2.  How many hosts do we need?
