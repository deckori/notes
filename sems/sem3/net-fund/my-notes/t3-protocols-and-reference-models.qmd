## Data access

In IPv4:

In 192.168.1.110:

$\underbrace{192.168.1}_{\text{Network part of address}}  \underbrace{110}_\text{\quad Host part of the address}$

In a local network, the network of the address should not be different but the same. Only the host part changes.

(Segement is encapsulated in Layer 3 info) is encapsulated in layer 2 info.

### Data Link Addresses

Each port of a router has different \index{MAC addresses}

### Role of the Data Link Layer Addresses: Different IP Networks

IP address is used for end to end connection, while mac address is used for connectivity in a segment of a network

MAC Addresses are kept locally in local network. It's not visible from another network

- MAC Addresses are a layer 2 address
- IP Addresses are a layer 3 address

| MAC | IP |
|-|-|
| Layer 2 address | Layer 3 address |
| Source to local destination communication | Source to remote device communication |
