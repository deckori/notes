1. When given the ip addr and subnet mask, while doing bit operationns on the given table, what calculations should we write?
2. DHCPv6 vs DHCPv4?
  - IPv4 - DHCPv4 One type: a server keeps track of ip addresses assigned to hosts
  - IPv6 - DHCPv6
    - SLAAC: every device generates ip configuration via routing advertisements. We cannot get domain name, who is my DNS server and what is it's address (for this we need to use SLAAC stateless DHCPv6)
      - Uses duplicate address detection
    - SLAAC with stateless DHCPv6: stateless means there is server maintaining a record of ip information of hosts
      - Uses duplicate address detection
    - SLAAC with stateful DHCPv6: same as DHCPv4
