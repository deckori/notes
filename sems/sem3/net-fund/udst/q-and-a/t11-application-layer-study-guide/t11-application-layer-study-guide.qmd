1. List the functions of the TCP/IP Application Layer as defined by the OSI Application, Presentation and Session layers. **(S3, S4)**
  - The application layer provides the interface between the applications and the underlying network
  - The presentation layer functions: Formatting, Compressing, and Encrypting
  - The session layer creates and maintains dialogs/sessions between source and destination applications
2. Give **five** examples ofmost widely known application layer protocols. **(S3)**
  - HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
  - FTP: File Transfer Protocol
  - TFTP: Trivial File Transfer Protocol
  - IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol
  - SMPT: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
  - POP: Post Office Protocol
  - DNS: Domain Name System
  - DNS Fully-qualified domain names
3. Which is the correct number sequence of the steps for the HTTP process to open a web page in a browser. (S5-8)
  -  ![](_page_0_Picture_12.jpeg)
  - 1. The web server sends the HTML code for the web page to the browser.
  - 2. The browser interprets the three parts of the URL
  - 3. The browser converts [www.cisco.com](http://www.cisco.com/) into an IP address.
  - 4. The browser deciphers the HTML code and formats the page for the browser window.
  - 5. The browser initiates an HTTP request to a web server.
    - A. 1, 3, 2, 5, 4
    - **B. 2, 3, 5, 1, 4**
    - C. 5, 3, 2, 1, 4
    - D. 2, 3, 4, 1, 5
4. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPs? **(S9)**
  - A. HTTPS is working at Layer 4 and HTTP at Layer 5
  - **B. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure protocol and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is not**
  - C. HTTP is a secure protocol and HTTPS is not
  - D. HTTPS is slow and HTTP fast
5. What are the three protocols that email relies on? **(S10)**
  - A. DHCP, POP, HTTP
  - B. SMTP, DNS, IMAP
  - **C. SMTP, POP, IMAP**
  - D. HTTP, POP, IMAP
6. What is the correct sequence numbers for the DNS process? **(S14-16)**
  - 1. The DNS server matches the FQDN with its IP address
  - 2. The user types an FQDN into a browser address field
  - 3. The client computer uses the IP address to make requests of the server
  - 4. A DNS query is sent to the designated DNS server for the client computer
  - 5. The DNS query response is sent back to the client with the IP address for the FQDN
    - A. 1, 3, 2, 5, 4
    - B. 2, 3, 5, 1, 4
    - C. 5, 3, 2, 1, 4
    - **D. 2, 4, 1, 5, 3**
7. Write the correct sequence numbers for the steps of DHCP operation (DORA).(S18)
  - Server replies with an offer message
  - Server returns an acknowledgement message to confirm the lease has been finalized
  - Client sends a request message to server it wants to use
  - Client broadcasts a discover message to identify any available DHCP servers on the network
    - A. 2, 4, 3, 1
    - B. 1, 3, 2, 4
    - **C. 2, 3, 1, 4**
    - D. 3, 2, 1, 4
8. Fill in the table belowfor each Mail Application Layer Protocol. (S11-13)
  - SMTP — (**Notes**)
  - POP — Post Office Protocol
    - Used to retrieve mail from a mail server
    - After downloading, messages are deleted from the server
    - Not recommended for small businesses that require centralized backup because messages are not stored on the server
  - IMAP — Internet Message Access Protocol
    - Another protocol used to retrieve email messages
    - The original messages remain on the server until manually deleted
    - Local copies are downloaded to the client application
9. Fill in the table belowfor the DHCP Application Layer Protocol. (S17)
  - DHCP — (**Notes**)
10. Fill in the table belowforthe FTP Application Layer Protocol. (S19)
  - FTP — (**Notes**)
