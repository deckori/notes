|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application           | Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control.             |
| Transport             | Supports communication between various devices across diverse<br>networks. |
| Internet              | Determines the best path through the network.                              |
| Network Access        | Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the<br>network.       |

5. Map the OSI layersto the TCP/IP model. (6) **(S27)**

|   | OSI Model    | TCP/IP Model   |
|---|--------------|----------------|
| 7 | Application  |                |
| 6 | Presentation | Application    |
| 5 | Session      |                |
| 4 | Transport    | Transport      |
| 3 | Network      | Internet       |
| 2 | Data Link    | Network Access |
| 1 | Physical     |                |

- 6. What is data encapsulation? (6) **(S6, S31, S32)**
  - **It's a top down process of placing one message format where protocols add their information to the data (the letter) inside another message format (the envelope) and is repeated by each layer.**

{2}------------------------------------------------

7. Fill in the correct protocol data unit (PDU) for each layer: (6) **(S31)**

| OSI Protocol Stack | PDUs    |
|--------------------|---------|
| Upper Layers       | Data    |
| Transport          | Segment |
| Network            | Packet  |
| Data Link          | Frame   |
| Physical           | Bits    |

8. What is the role of the following types of addresses? (4) **(S34)**

| Address Type                 | Role/Responsibility                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Network layer addresses      | Responsible for delivering the IP packet from original source<br>to<br>the final destination.                                  |
| Data Link<br>layer addresses | Responsible for delivering the data link frame from one<br>network interface card (NIC) to another NIC on the same<br>network. |

- 9. What addresses are contained in the IP packet header? (2) (**S35)**
  - **a. Source IP address.**
  - **b. Destination IP address.**
- 10. What addresses are contained in the Ethernet Frame Header? (2) (**S36)**
  - **a. The Source MAC address.**
  - **b. The Destination MAC address.**
- 11. What is the purpose of the Default Gateway? (4) (**S38)**
  - **The default gateway (DGW) is the "door" or "gateway" to all other remote locations and has an IP address that is part of the local LAN.**
- 12. When is an Ethernet Frame sent to the Default Gateway? **(S38)**
  - **When the final destination is remote, the data link frame will use the MAC address of the default gateway.**

13. Answer the following questions based on the diagram below: (10) **(S36 – S38)**

![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)

- a. When sending data from PC1 to the Web Server, what are:
  - 1) The source IP address **192.168.1.110**, the destination IP address **172.16.1.99**.
  - 2) The source MAC address **AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA**, and the destination MAC address **11-11-11- 11-11-11**.
- b. When sending data from PC1 to the FTP Server, what are:
  - 1) The source IP address **192.168.1.110**, the destination IP address **192.168.1.9**.
  - 2) The source MAC address **AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA** , and The destination MAC address **CC-CC-CC-CC-CC-CC.**
- c. What is the Default Gateway address for PC1 and FTP Server?

## **192.168.1.1**

d. What is the Default Gateway address for the Web server?

## **172.16.1.1**

- 14. What is the address of the default gateway (DGW)? (S38)
  - **The IP address of the DGW is the IP address of the router interface connected to the local LAN.**
- 15. What happens if a device does not have the default gateway address configured? (S38)
  - **All devices on the LAN must be told about this address or their traffic will be confined to the LAN only.**
