Objectives achieved:

- Configured and operated a 4-bit asynchronous ripple counter circuit
- Intepreted output waveforms of the ripple counter

For part 1, we studied and recorded the basic operations conducted on an asynchronous ripple counter. We manipulated the clock signal to get outputs, observed how the inputs affect the outputs, interpreted the outputs to get a binary number, and converted them to other numerical formats. We found the count range of the 4 bit counter to be (0)_10 to (15)_10.

For part 2, we studied the waveforms of the outputs and the clock with an oscilloscope. We found the frequency of the output of each FF to be half off that of their respective inputs. The given FFs activate on the negative edge of CLK input.

In conclusion, we were introduced to asynchronous ripple counters and became proficient in their usage and their various attributes.
