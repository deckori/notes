There is no CLEAR "Button" in the board used in the video, but the CLEAR function was used by the presenter. Assuming that is what is being asked, after the CLEAR operation, the UP LEDs were off and all the DOWN LEDs were ON
# 2

All UP LEDs were ON and all DOWN LEDs were off

# 3

BIT4 has slowest frequency. This is because each flip flop divides their input frequency by 2. We have 4 inputs, 1 for each flip flop. At the 4th input, for 1 cycle we have 16 cycles at the 1st input. This mathematically aligns with the following result:

1st FF: 16/2 = 8
2nd FF: 8/2 = 4
3rd FF: 4/2 = 2
4th FF: 2/2 = 1
