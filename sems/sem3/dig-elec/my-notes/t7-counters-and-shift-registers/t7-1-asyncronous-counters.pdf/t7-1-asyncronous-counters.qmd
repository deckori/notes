# Objectives

- Define the counters
- Recognize counter classifications
- Recognize the MOD/Ripple Counters
- Design a ripple counter

{2}------------------------------------------------

### Digital Counters

> - Used to count pulses
> - Used as a frequency divider

- A digital counter is a set of flip-flops whose states change in response to pulses applied at the input to another. A counter is used to count pulses.
- A counter can also be used as a frequency divider to obtain waveforms with frequencies that are specific fractions of the clock frequency.
- They are used for counting the number of occurrences of an event and are useful for generating timing sequences to control operations in a digital system.

### COUNTERS

| ASYNCHRONOUS | SYNCHRONOUS |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Flip-flops are connected in such a way that output of first flip-flop drives the clock for the next flip-flop. | No connection between output of first flip-flop and clock input of next flip-flop. |
| All the flip-flops are not clocked simultaneously. | All the flip-flops are clocked simultaneously. |
| Logic circuit is simple even for more number of states. | Design involves complex logic circuit as number of states increases. |
| Main drawback is their low speed as the clock is propagated through number of flip-flops before it reaches last flip-flop. | As the clock is simultaneously given to all flip-flops there is no problem of propagation delay. |

### Modulus of the counter

- The number of states through which the counter passes before returning to the starting state is called the *modulus of the counter*.

> i.e., Maximum number that the counter is able to count

- Hence, the modulus of a counter is equal to the total number of distinct states including zero that a counter can store
- A counter may have a shortened modulus, and thus does not utilize all the possible states
- The condition to determine the number of flip-flops is

$$\text{MOD number, N} \leq 2^n$$

Where $n$ is the number of flip-flops.

- The MOD number of a counter also indicates the frequency division obtained from the last FF.
- MOD-16 can be used to divide the input pulse frequency by a factor of 16 (the MOD number)

{5}------------------------------------------------

### Modulus and State Diagram

> this tells us how the inputs relate to the outputs in the counter

- If N flip-flops are connected the counter will have 2 N different states, and so it is a MOD- 2<sup>N</sup> counter. It would be capable of counting up to 2 <sup>N</sup>-1 before returning to its 0 state.
- In counters we concern about toggle mode so can use JK-FF, T-FF and D-FF.
- The state diagram is a graphical representation for the truth table of the counter
- For example, if we have 2 FFs we can count up to 3 and the state diagram as below

{6}------------------------------------------------

## Ripple (Asynchronous) Counter

- In ripple counter, the flip-flops within the counter are not made to change the states at exactly the same time, i.e., they are not clocked simultaneously.
- In a ripple counter, also called an *asynchronous counter* or a *serial counter*, the clock input is applied only to the first flip-flop, also called the input flip flop, in the cascaded arrangement.
- The clock input to any subsequent flip-flop comes from the output of its immediately

## A 2-Bit Asynchronous Binary Counter

- This counter is asynchronous because there is no common clock pulse.
- The clocks are cascaded

> Note: Here, for FF1, C is active-high despite the bubble on it's input. The bubble belongs to FF0, not to FF1.

- Since the modulus or mod number of the counter is 8, it requires 3 flip-flops.
- The counter is negative edge triggering
- Note how we return to state 000 at the 8th clock For this counter 1- Draw the truth table, show the clock counting, and the decimal No.
- 2- Draw the sate Diagram

## Binary Ripple Counters with a Modulus of Less than 2<sup>N</sup>

#### Design a MOD 6 Ripple counter using JK flip-flops.

- •Count the number of states including zero states to get mod number = 6, and in the immediate next state i.e., in 110 state, $Q_2=1$ , $Q_1=1$
- •Connect $Q_2$ and $Q_1$ to a NAND gate and the output of the gate to clear input of the flip-flops.
- •Hence after state 101, when the circuit enters into state 110, the NAND output becomes 0 and hence the flip-flops will be in reset state, 000 and the count continues.
- •Though the counter enters into 7<sup>th</sup> state, the time it spends in that state is negligible (propagation delay of NAND gate).
- •Hence the counter is treated as a MOD 6 counter with states 000 to 101

{13}------------------------------------------------

# Example: MOD 10 Ripple counter/Decade counter

• Use JK-FF to design MOD 10 ripple counter.

#### Solution:

- 1- This mean that the ordinary mode is MOD 16 so we need 4 JK-FFs
- 2- Draw the sate diagram and the truth table
- 3-We have to reset the counter after state 9 so we decode count 10 with a NAND to clear the inputs of FF
- 4-The input of the NAND gate is from the Q outputs of FF1 and FF3
