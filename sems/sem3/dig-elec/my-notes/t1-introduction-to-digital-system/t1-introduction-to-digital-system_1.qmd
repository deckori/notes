# Outcomes

By end of this lecture\, student should be able to:

Distinguish between analog and digital representations\.

Cite the advantages and drawbacks of digital techniques compared with analog\.

Understand the need for analog\-to\-digital converters \(ADCs\) and digital\-to\-analog converters \(DACs\)\.

Identify typical digital signals & a timing diagram

# Analog and Digital Signals



* Analog system
  * A combination of devices that manipulate values represented in analog form\.
  * The physical quantities or signals may vary continuously over a specified range\.
* Digital system
  * A combination of devices that manipulate values represented in digital form\.
  * The physical quantities or signals can assume only discrete values\.
  * Greater accuracy\.

# Analog and Digital Representations



* Digital Representation—varies in discrete \(separate\) steps\.
  * Passing time is shown as a change in the display on a digital clock at one\-minute intervals\.
  * A change in temperature is shown on a digital display only when the temperature changes at least one degree\.


![](t1-introduction-to-digital-system-img/Topic 1 Introduction to Digital System_1.jpg)



* Analog Representation—a continuously variable\, proportional indicator\.
  * Sound through a microphone causes voltage changes\.
  * Automobile speedometer changes with speed\.
  * Mercury thermometer varies over a range of values with temperature\.

# Binary Digital Signal



* An information variable represented by physical quantity\.
* For digital systems\, the variable takes on discrete values\.
  * Two level\, or binary values are the most prevalent values\.
* Binary values are represented abstractly by:
  * Digits 0 and 1
  * Words \(symbols\) False \(F\) and True \(T\)
  * Words \(symbols\) Low \(L\) and High \(H\)
  * And words On and Off
* Binary values are represented by values or ranges of values
* of physical quantities\.

# Logic gates

A Logic Gate is an electronic circuit that performs a specific logical function\.

Works with digital signals \(0 and 1\)

Words \(symbols\) False \(F\) and True \(T\)

Each gate follows a defined rule to produce an output based on its inputs\.

Example – AND Gate:

Output = 1 only if all inputs are 1\.

# Families of Logic Gates

<span style="color:#202122">I</span>  <span style="color:#202122">ntegrated circuit \(IC\)\, </span> also known as a microchip\, computer chip\, or simply chip\, is a small electronic device made up of multiple interconnected electronic components such as [transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor)\, [resistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor)\, and [capacitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor)\. These components are etched onto a small piece of [semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor) material\, usually [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon)\.

Families of logic gates:

__TTL__  – Transistor Transistor Logic

__CMOS__  – Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor

# Physical Construction – DIP Packages

Dual Inline Package

Pin spacing = 0\.1”

Suitable for prototyping boards\, PCB\, perfboards\, etc\.

Pins numbered CCW from top left

Usually\, but not always\, \+Vcc is at upper right\, Ground at lower left\.

# Digital Signals: 0, 1, and Voltage Levels

Digital systems work with two states: Logic 0 \(LOW\) and Logic 1 \(HIGH\)\.

These states are represented using voltage ranges rather than exact values\.

Example \(TTL 5V Logic\):

Logic 0 \(LOW\): 0V → 0\.8V

Logic 1 \(HIGH\): 2V → 5V

Invalid Region: 0\.8V → 2V \(undefined\)

![](t1-introduction-to-digital-system-img/Topic 1 Introduction to Digital System_9.png)

Example \(3\.3V Logic\):

Meaning:

Logic 0 = OFF\, False\, or No current

Logic 1 = ON\, True\, or Current present

Invalid = System cannot decide if 0 or 1 → may cause errors

# Advantages of Digital Systems



  * Ease of design
  * Well suited for storing information\.
  * Accuracy and precision are easier to maintain\.
  * Programmable operation\.
  * Less affected by noise\.
  * Ease of fabrication on IC chips\.
# Limitations to Digital Techniques



  * Because the world is naturally analog\, signals must be converted into digital form\.
  * This conversion\, however\, takes time\, reduces accuracy\, and often requires complex hardware\, making it a key limitation in digital electronics
* How to convert?
* The process of converting an analog signal to a digital signal is called  <span style="color:#ff0000">ADC</span>
* The process of converting a digital signal to an analog signal is called  <span style="color:#ff0000">DAC</span> \.
# Example of ADC: Comparators

Comparators is an electronic device that allow an analog input to produce a digital output\.

Output is based on the comparison of the input voltages\.

The comparators compare the input voltages with the 5 voltage\.

Note how the output \(green\) is \+5 volts when the analog input \(blue\) exceeds the reference voltage \(red\)\, otherwise the output is zero\.
