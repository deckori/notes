# Digital pulses

**Digital waveforms** are made of a series of pulses (discrete electrical voltage levels).

Discrete electrical signals are used to represent binary states (low and high) in digital systems for data transmission, timing, and control. These pulses are generated by fast-switching electronic devices.

**Periodic signal** is a signal that repeats its pattern exactly after a fixed duration (time) called the period (T).

**Aperiodic signal** is a signal that does not repeat itself over time and therefore has no fundamental period

**Frequency**, $F = \frac{1}T$

A **positive pulse** has an active-HIGH level while the **negative pulse** has an active-LOW level.

Positive Going Transition (**PGT**) – **Rising Edge**

Negative Going Transition (**NGT**) – **Falling Edge**

**Pulse Width**: Time between edges.

> Leading edge: the first edge (rising or falling).
>
> Trailing edge: the last edge (rising or falling).

# Actual raising and falling time

In actual circuits it takes time for a pulse waveform to change from one level to the other.

The raising and falling time is measured between the 90% and 10% points on the leading or *trailing edge respectively*

The pulse width is the time between the points when the leading and trailing edges are at 50%.

> Rise time ($t_r$): time taken to go from 10% to 90%
>
> Fall time ($t_f$): time taken to go from 90% to 10%

# Clock Signal

$$
\text{Duty cycle} = \frac{t_w}{T}
$$

OR

$$
\text{Duty cycle} = \frac{t_w}{T} \times 100 \%
$$

# Sequential circuit

The logic circuits considered thus far have been combinational circuits whose output levels at any instant of time are dependent on the levels present at the inputs at that time.

Any prior input-level conditions have no effect on the present outputs because combinational logic circuits have no memory.

Most digital systems consist of both combinational circuits and memory elements.

# Electronic Latches

-   Digital circuits that store a single bit of information
-   Used in digital systems as temporary storage elements
-   Latches are built using NAND or NOR gates
-   Types of latches:
    -   SR Latches
    -   Gated SR Latches
    -   D Latches
    -   Gated D Latches
    -   JK Latches \# SR latch – NAND

$$
\text{Duty cycle} = \frac{t_w}{T} \times 100 \%
$$There are two possible states for the output Q when both inputs are 1.

When SET = CLEAR = 1 then Q = no change.

Whether Q = 0 or Q = 1 depends on which input changed most recently.

The output of the circuit depends on the past state of the inputs

This circuit has memory.

There are two possible states for the output Q when both inputs are 0.

When SET = RESET = 0 then Q = no change.

Whether Q = 0 or Q = 1 depends on most recently state.

The output of the circuit depends on the past state of the inputs

This circuit has memory.

# Example

The waveforms below are applied to the inputs of a LOW active latch. Assume that initially Q = 0, and determine the Q waveform.

# Controlled latch

Digital systems can operate either asynchronously or synchronously.

Asynchronous system—outputs can change state at any time the input(s) change.

Synchronous system—output can change state only at a specific time in the clock cycle.

# Data (D or Transparent) Flip Flop

The difficulty with the above latches is that the Set and Reset inputs must always be at opposite logic levels in order for the operation of the latch to be meaningful.

Also, there are disallowed states.

By simply introducing one inverter into the circuit, we can automate this functionality and convert the simple SR latch into a D Flip Flop.
