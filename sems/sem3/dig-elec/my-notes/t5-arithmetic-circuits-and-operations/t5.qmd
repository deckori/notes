## Sign Extension

If we have a normal unsigned number or a positive signed number, we increase the number of bits by appending zeroes.

*Exception*: In case of a negative signed number, we append ones to increase the number of bits.

## Special Case in 2's Complement Representation

Complete range of values that can be represented in the 2's complement system having $n$ magnitude bits:

$$-2^n+(2^n-1)$$

In signed numbers, when you do an arithmetic operation and get overflow, you place the overflow bits between the magnitude bits and the sign bit.

If you have a negative binary number of type two's complement, you have to apply 2's complement to get it's magnitude
