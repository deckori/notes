# Objectives:

By the end of this topic, students will be able to:

Understand the basic building blocks of a microprocessor system

Explain the function of each part

Describe digital Input / Output operating principles in the microprocessor system

Relate microprocessor parts to real applications, such as how a washing machine uses inputs, outputs, CPU, ALU, and memory to run its cycle.

Differentiate between high-level languages, assembly language, and machine language.

# What Are Microprocessor Based Systems?

- Microprocessor
  - Central unit of a computer system
  - Responsible for performing calculations, executing instructions, and managing data
  - It contains the CPU on a single chip
  - Designed for high-performance tasks that require fast processing and large memory
  - Commonly used in computers, laptops, and advanced electronic systems where complex operations and multitasking are needed
- We will concentrate on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) which are used in industrial settings to control processes or equipment

# Functional Blocks of a Microprocessor Based System

A PLC has five main blocks:

Inputs: to connect to the field process

Outputs: to connect to the field process

Central Processing Unit: (with memory) to provide the control function

Power Supply: to provide power to the various blocks

Programming Device or Human Machine Interface (HMI): to program and operate the PLC

> Optical isolation means that the surroundings of the isolation is connected via optical circuits

# Input & Output Forms – Why Isolation and Conversion?

Input Port:

- Isolation: Protects the CPU from high voltage and electrical noise coming from sensors.
- Conversion: Converts real-world signals (analog/high voltage) into clean digital signals the CPU can read.

Output Port:

- Isolation: Protects the CPU from back-EMF and spikes from motors, relays, and other loads.
- Conversion: Converts the CPU’s small digital signal into the proper voltage/current needed to drive real devices.

# Real World Application

How do you think the washing machine uses its microprocessor parts (CPU, ALU, CU, RAM, ROM)?

Where do you think the inputs come from and what outputs does it control?

Discuss which real components in the washing machine match each microprocessor block.

# Inputs & Outputs in the Washing Machine

Inputs (Sensors & User Signals):

Water level sensor

Temperature sensor

Door lock sensor

User buttons / control panel

Outputs(ControlledDevices):

Water valve (fill water)

Heater (heat water)

Drum motor (wash & spin)

Drain pump (remove water)

Display / indicators

# CPU, ALU, CU, and Memory

CPU(CentralProcessingUnit):

Executes the washing program and controls the full sequence.

- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):
  - Compares sensor values (water level, temperature)
  - Calculates timing and cycle operations
- CU (Control Unit): 
  - Sends control signals to outputs
  - Ensures correct order (fill → heat → wash → drain)
-  Memory: 
  - ROM : stores permanent wash programs and firmware
  - RAM : holds temporary sensor values, timers, and current cycle step

# Programming Languages

A processor can only understand machine language (0s and 1s), so any program written in another language must be translated for the processor to execute it.

1- High-Level Languages

- C++, Python, Java.Easy for humans, but must be compiled/interpreted into machine code.

2- Assembly Language

- Closer to hardware and easier than binary.An assembler converts it to machine code.
- Reduced, very limited vocabular
- Simple words only

3- Machine Language 

- The processor’s native binary code(0s and 1s that the CPU executes directly).

# Microprocessor Vs Microcontroller

You may have heard about microprocessors and microcontrollers, and while they sound similar, they are not the same. Each one is designed for a different purpose, and knowing the difference helps you choose the right device for your system.
