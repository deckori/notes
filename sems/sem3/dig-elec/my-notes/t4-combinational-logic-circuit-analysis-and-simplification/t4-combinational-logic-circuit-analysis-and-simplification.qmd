## De Morgan's Theorem

##### Simply put:

In a Boolean expression:

1.  Break the bar
2.  Change the gate, i.e., AND $\leftrightharpoons$ OR

In a gate drawing:

1.  Change the gate, i.e., AND $\leftrightharpoons$ OR
2.  Add a bubble where is none, remove a bubble where there is one

## Constructing Gates from a Truth Table

In a given truth table:

-   Choose OR (SOP - 1 output) or AND (POS - 0 output) logic
-   Construct the Boolean expression
-   Construct the logic circuit from the Boolean expression

## Logic Gate - Exclusive-OR Gate

Differing inputs give a high output. Same gives a low output

## Boolean Theorem

4.  $x.x' = 0 = x.\overline{x}$

## Commercial TTL Full Adder Chip

This full adder chip has 4 full adders in it for it 4 bit inputs for each input. The more the number of bits the inputs, the more the number of full adders needed.

## Add or Subtract circuit

We use an XOR gate instead of a not gate so that we can use one construction of a circuit to do \*\*either one\* of addition or subtraction.
