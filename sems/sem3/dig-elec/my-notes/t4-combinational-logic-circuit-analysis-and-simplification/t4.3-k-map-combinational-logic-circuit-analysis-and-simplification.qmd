# Karnaugh Mapping

What is Karnaugh Mapping (or K-Map)?

-   It is another way of representing a truth table, or equivalently, a graphical representation of a boolean function.
-   It is composed of a $n\times n$ sized grid, where each cell corresponds to a unique combination of input variables.
-   Adjacent cells differ by only 1 variable
-   Compared to a truth table, K-Maps:
    -   Patterns in the K-Map readily show logical groupings of $2^n, n \in \mathbb{W}$
    -   Allows us to minimize the complexity of our logic designs.
    -   Theoretically can be used for any number of input variables, but practically limited upto 5 or 6 variables

# 2-Variable K-Map

-   A function with 2 variables, A and B, can be mapped on a simple 1-dimensional K-Map
-   An unpopulated K-Map is shown below:

-   The logical values of A and B are shown above each cell, e.g. AB
-   The numerical equivalents of AB are shown at the bottom of each cell, e.g. 11
-   When variable A is true, it is shown by a bracket above the columns. Same with variable B.

# K-Maps – 3 Variables

-   We add another row to the map.
-   Variables are A, B and C
-   Adjacent K map square differ in only one variable both horizontally and vertically.

The 3 variables K- map using minterms can be written as below:

We will now develop a large K-Map which can display 4 variables:

The 4 variables K-map using minterms can be written as below:

# Filling K-Map

Draw the K-Map X(A, B, C, D) = $\Sigma\ m(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)$

> **Steps:**
>
> -   Convert the decimals to binary
> -   Input the binary numbers into their respective cells:
>     -   If an SOP expression is given, we input the binary numbers to cells that give an output of 1.
>     -   If a POS expression is given, we input the binary numbers to cells that give an output of 0.

Alternate expression: $\Pi\ M(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)$

SOP:

For thekjk 1st cell, beginning term is $\bar{A}B\bar{C}D$

POS: For the 1st cell, beginning term is $ABCD$

# How to View a K-Map

![](t4.3-k-map-combinational-logic-circuit-analysis-and-simplification-img/k-map-3d-representation.png){#fig-k-map-3d-representation align="center" width="300" alt="k-map-3d-representation.png"}

Think of a K-Map as being rolled up in both directions

Cells on one side abut against cells on the other side and are considered to be continuous

Similarly, cells on the top are considered to join up with cells on the bottom.

# Rules for Grouping Cells in Karnaugh Maps

Cells containing 1’s can be grouped together.

A SOP expression can be obtained by ORing all squares that contain a 1.

Groups cannot contain 0’s.

All cells containing 1’s must be accounted for when grouping.

Groupings must contain $2^n$ cells, for example, 1, 2, 4, 8, … No other amounts are allowed to be grouped.

Groups can be square or rectangular or may contain a single cell, but groups cannot be diagonal or have any other shape.

Cells containing 1’s can adjoin cells also containing 1’s on the opposite edge of the K-Map in order to form a group.

Groups of cells can overlap each other.

For most effective reduction, make each group as large as possible.

# Looking for Patterns in K-Maps

**OCTETS** - Blocks of 8 are golden. They signify that *we can reduce all of the logic in that block down to a single variable* , even though 4 variables are shown.

![](topic-4.3-k-map-combinational-logic-circuit-analysis-and-simplification-img/k-map-pattern-weird.png)

> This is a group of 8s as k maps are continuous horizontally or vertically

# Blocks of 4 - Quads

![](topic-4.3-k-map-combinational-logic-circuit-analysis-and-simplification-img/k-map-group-of-4.png)

> Final, bottom, left, square is a group of 4 due to horizontal and vertical continuity

> Minimize an expression means to simplify

Wrapping cells around the edges of the K-Map results in additional quads.

Don’t forget that cells in four corners also make up a quad.

# Blocks of 2 - Pairs

Quads signify that we can reduce all of the logic in that block down to 3 variables.

Here some obvious and less obvious pairs:

![](topic-4.3-k-map-combinational-logic-circuit-analysis-and-simplification-img/k-map-group-of-2-2nd.png)

> In kmaps, diagonal continuity does not exist

> In kmaps, we can reuse cells, i.e., we can use a previously simplified cell with another cell to simplify as a group of 2

> We need the biggest group and the smallest group. Every group is a term. The bigger group the group, less are the number of resultant variables in the boolean expression.

# Single one’s

Isolated cells are called singles.

They can exist anywhere on the K-Map.

Each cell requires 4 variable to describe it.

Some examples are shown below:

# Singles Only

Make a boolean expression

> $\mathrm{X = \bar{A}\bar{B}\bar{C}D + \bar{A}BCD + A\bar{B}\bar{C}\bar{D}}$

# Example 1

> Why make kmaps?

> They help us in building circuits better as they simplify circuits. Simplified circuits are easier to deal with and allow us to fix it better when issues arise.

# Filling K Map from Boolean Expression

K map can be filled by using the following steps:

Get the expression into SOP form if it is not already in that form.

For each product term in the SOP expression, place a 1 in each K-map square whose label contains the same combination of input variables.

Place a 0 in all other squares.

# Example 1:

> In a boolean expression that isn't standard, you can add the missing variables by using the boolean property, $A+\bar{A}=1$. 1 doesn't change the output of the expression

# Example 3:

Let’s design a logic circuit that controls an elevator door in a three-story building.

The circuit in the Figure has four inputs.

M is a logic signal that indicates when the elevator is moving

(M= 1) or stopped (M= 0).

F1, F2, and F3 are floor indicator signals that are normally LOW, and they go HIGH only when the elevator is positioned at the level of that particular floor.

For example, when the elevator is lined up level with the second floor, F2 = 1 and F1 = F3 = 0. The circuit output is the OPEN signal, which is normally LOW and will go HIGH when the elevator door is to be opened.
