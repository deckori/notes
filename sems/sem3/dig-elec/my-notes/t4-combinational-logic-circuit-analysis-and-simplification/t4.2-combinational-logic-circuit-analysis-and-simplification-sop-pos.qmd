## Standard Terms

Have all the variables

### Minterms and Maxterms

-   A minterm (standard product): a standard AND term
    -   For example, two binary variables $x$ and $y,$
        -   $xy$ $,$ $xy$ $',$ $x'y$ $,$ $x'y$ $'$
    -   It is also called a standard product.
    -   $n$ variables can be combined to form 2 $n$ minterms.
-   A maxterm (standard sums): an OR term
    -   For example, two binary variables $x$ and $y,$
        -   $x+y$ $,$ $x+y$ $’,$ $x’+y$ $,$ $x’+y$ $’$
    -   It is also called a standard sum.
    -   2 $n$ maxterms.
    -   Each *maxterm* is the complement of its corresponding *minterm* , and vice versa.

## SOP And POS

An SOP (Sum of Products) circuit is in the form of groups of AND gates collected by OR gates, note this is sum of minterms

A POS (Product of Sums) circuit is in the form of groups of OR gates collected by AND gates, note this is AND of maxterms

## SOP

#### Input expressions and minterms :

-   If the value of the Boolean variable is 1 then we will take the variable without complementing it.

-   If the value of the Boolean variable is 0 then we will take the variable by complementing it.

Output:

The output function can be written in SOP form by adding all the min-terms when the output is HIGH(1).

| **Variable** |     | **Minterm** |                |
|:------------:|:---:|:-----------:|:--------------:|
|      A       |  B  |    Term     | Representation |
|      0       |  0  |    A’B’     |       m0       |
|      0       |  1  |     A’B     |       m1       |
|      1       |  0  |     AB’     |       m2       |
|      1       |  1  |     AB      |       m3       |

## Example of SOP 1

Use the SOP to write the canonical form for the Truth Table

Design a logic circuit with three inputs, A, B, and C. Output to be HIGH only when a majority inputs are HIGH.

Solution:

## POS

Input expressions and Maxterms:

-   If the value of the Boolean variable is 0, then we will take the variable without complementing it.

-   If the value of the Boolean variable is 1, then we will take the variable by complementing it.

Output:

The output function can be written in SOP form by adding all the min-terms when the output is HIGH( 0 ).

| **Variable** |     | **Maxterm** |                |
|:------------:|:---:|:-----------:|:--------------:|
|      A       |  B  |    Term     | Representation |
|      0       |  0  |     A+B     |       M0       |
|      0       |  1  |    A+B’     |       M1       |
|      1       |  0  |    A’+B     |       M2       |
|      1       |  1  |    A’+B’    |       M3       |

## Example of POS

Use the POS to write the canonical form for the Truth Table

Solution

# Inc

## Exercise:

Write the canonical form for the below truth table using SOP and POS, and use DeMorgan’s theorem to prove that the two expressions are equivalent

## Simplifying Logic Circuits

The logic circuits can be simplified using Boolean algebra and Karnaugh mapping

If you have a complex logic circuit, write the expression of the output then simplify using Boolean theorems

For the truth table find the SOP or POS then simplify it using Boolean and Demorgan’s theorem

The simplified expression called minimal

> You can quickly fill out the output truth table of a Boolean expression:
>
> - Simplify it to an SOP
> - Find the inputs for each term such the it gives out an output of 1
> - Repeat for other terms
> - Unincluded possibilities should be given a 0 output
> - If a variable is not in a term, you can ignore it for that term while evaluating the outputs
