Set: Go to 1 when active (high)

Reset: Go to 0 when active (high)

Glitches occur when set and reset are active. You cannot predict the output. This state is invalid.

In a latch:

-   E for enable
-   C for clock

## flip flop

Between edges, the waveforms undergoes NC (No change)

Example:

| Clk | S   | R   | Q         | Q'        |
|-----|-----|-----|-----------|-----------|
| $\uparrow$   | 0   | 0   | NC        | NC       |
| $\uparrow$   | 0   | 1   | 0         | 1         |
| $\uparrow$   | 1   | 0   | 1         | 0         |
| $\uparrow$   | 1   | 1   | Undefined | Undefined |
| $\downarrow$   | X   | X   | NC        | NC       |
