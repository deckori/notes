### **Digital pulses**

-   Digital waveforms are made of a series of pulses (discrete electrical voltage levels).
-   Discrete electrical signals are used to represent binary states (low and high) in digital systems for data transmission, timing, and control. These pulses are generated by fastswitching electronic devices.
-   Periodic signal is a signal that repeats its pattern exactly after a fixed duration (time) called the period (T).
-   Aperiodic signal is a signal that does not repeat itself over time and therefore has no fundamental period
-   Frequency F = 1/T.

### **Digital pulses**

-   A positive pulse has an active-HIGH level while the negative pulse has an active-LOW level.
-   Positive Going Transition (PGT) Rising Edge
-   Negative Going Transition (NGT) Falling Edge
-   Pulse Width time between edges.

### **Actual raising and falling time**

-   In actual circuits it takes time for a pulse waveform to change from one level to the other.
-   The raising and falling time is measured between the 90% and 10% points on the leading or *trailing edge respectively*
-   The pulse width is the time between the points when the leading and trailing edges are at 50%.

### **Clock Signal**

-   The duty cycle is the ratio of the pulse width to the period and is usually expressed in percentage

\% Duty cycle=(tw/T)\*100%

When a pulse waveform is used to synchronize (control) a digital circuit it is called a clock or clock signal

Clock signals do not have to have a 50% duty cycle but often do

## **Triggering**

![](_page_6_Picture_1.jpeg)

-   It is possible to use clock pulses to control other triggered devices that should change their state only within certain time

-   There are two types of triggering

### **Sequential circuit**

-   The logic circuits considered thus far have been combinational circuits whose output levels at any instant of time are dependent on the levels present at the inputs at that time.

-   Any prior input-level conditions have no effect on the present outputs because combinational logic circuits have no memory.

-   Most digital systems consist of both combinational circuits and memory

elements.

-   Digital circuits that store a single bit of information
-   Used in digital systems as temporary storage elements
-   Latches are built using NAND or NOR gates
-   Types of latches:
    -   SR Latches
    -   Gated SR Latches
    -   D Latches
    -   Gated D Latches
    -   JK Latches

-   Note that the outputs are complementary, that is, Q and $\overline{Q}$

| 1   | 1     | No change |     |
| 0   | 1     | Q = 1     |     |
| 1   | 0     | Q = 0     |     |

-   There are two possible states for the output Q when both inputs are 1.
-   When SET = CLEAR = 1 then Q = no change.
-   Whether Q = 0 or Q = 1 depends on which input changed most recently.
-   The output of the circuit depends on the past state of the inputs
-   This circuit has memory.

### **Controlled latch**

![](_page_17_Picture_1.jpeg)

-   Digital systems can operate either asynchronously or synchronously.
-   ➢ Asynchronous system—outputs can change state at any time the input(s) change.
-   ➢ Synchronous system—output can change state only at a specific time in the clock cycle.

### **Basic Gated Latch**

![](_page_18_Picture_1.jpeg)

-   When the Enable (E) input is a 0, the NAND gates in front of the Latch will output a 1 no matter what the inputs S or R are. The Latch is Disabled.
-   When the Enable (E) input is a 1, the output of the NAND gates in front of the latch will depend on the S and R inputs as in the table below. The Latch is Enabled.
-   This is now a high active SR controlled Latch

![](_page_18_Picture_5.jpeg)

| E   | S      | R      | Q       |
|-----|--------|--------|---------|
| 0   | 1 or 0 | 1 or 0 | NC      |
| 1   | 0      | 0      | NC      |
| 1   | 0      | 1      | 0       |
| 1   | 1      | 0      | 1       |
| 1   | 1      | 1      | Invalid |

### **Controlled Latches**

![](_page_19_Picture_1.jpeg)

-   Similarly we can control a NOR Gate latch
-   This is also a HIGH active controlled Latch

![](_page_19_Picture_4.jpeg)

| E   | S      | R      | Q       |
|-----|--------|--------|---------|
| 0   | 1 or 0 | 1 or 0 | NC      |
| 1   | 0      | 0      | NC      |
| 1   | 0      | 1      | 0       |
| 1   | 1      | 0      | 1       |
| 1   | 1      | 1      | Invalid |

### **Controlled Latches**

    -   NAND gate
    -   NOR gate
    -   OR gate

### **Data (D or Transparent) Flip Flop**

![](_page_22_Picture_2.jpeg)

-   The difficulty with the above latches is that the Set and Reset inputs must always be at opposite logic levels in order for the operation of the latch to be meaningful.
-   Also, there are disallowed states.
-   By simply introducing one inverter into the circuit, we can automate this functionality and convert the simple SR latch into a D Flip Flop.

| E   | D   | Q   |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | 0   | NC  |
| 0   | 1   | NC  |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |
